# Security Policy

## Our Commitment
At celerix-dev, user privacy and security are our highest priorities. Because our software is designed to run locally and handle user data without telemetry, we take any potential local vulnerability or data-leak risk very seriously.

## Supported Versions
Only the latest stable version of each repository is actively supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you discover a security-related bug, please report it via one of the following methods:
1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting:** Use the "Report a vulnerability" button under the Security tab of the specific repository.
2. **Email:** info@celerix.dev

We aim to acknowledge all reports within 48 hours and provide a fix or mitigation plan within 7 days.

## Privacy Guarantee
We do not collect telemetry. If a security fix requires a change in how data is handled, we will provide a transparent technical breakdown of the change.
